If so, why not book on to our fantastic Summer Day Camp on Wednesday 19 August 10.30-3.30pm at the People’s Community Garden, on Maidenhall Allotments. ‘Beetlejuice’ will give children the opportunity to explore the gardens, pick their own produce and get involved in some fun nature and craft activities. This month we will be making a mini-beast mansion, toad houses and butterfly feeders. Then we will pick some tomatoes to make our very own community garden ketchup to serve with some home-made wedges with potatoes dug from the gardens. This workshop will give children a chance to get closer to nature in an urban green space, as well as learning about cooking and healthy eating. Children are asked to bring a packed lunch with a bottle of juice/ water which can be refilled. They will also need to wear outdoor clothes which they don’t mind getting dirty, and sturdy boots or wellies. If it is warm, a sun hat is advisable, with sun cream applied in advance. If it’s chilly or wet - then please dress accordingly. We will go ahead in all but the very worst weathers. If in doubt please call 07760 583950 on the day. Cost: £7.50 per child and £5 for additional children of the same family. Children must be aged four or over. Parents are of course welcome to stay and get involved! In order to secure a place for your child please<strong> book in advance</strong> with ActivLives on 01473 345350.

You&nbsp;can\'t beat the taste of fresh picked fruit! Strawberry season in Suffolk starts,&nbsp;depending on the weather, either at the end of May or June. We asked&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/GoslingsFarmGardenCafe?fref=ts\\">Goslings Farm </a>about their \\"PYO experience\\" and they had a few words of advice:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>What are your tips on picking the best strawberries?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Check they are ripe and red all the way round, Strawberries ripen nearest the sun/light first, and &nbsp;they have more flavour and sweetness when they are ripe. Also at our PYO, everyone picks the 1st plant they come to!!, so it’s best to go to the other end and the outside rows for the best strawberries!! Select firm, fully red berries. Strawberries DO NOT continue to ripen after they are picked! In the photo, only the berry on&nbsp;the far right is completely ripe.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Why would you recommend \\"pick your own\\" rather than buying them in supermarkets?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are many reasons to pick your own rather than just buying them from the shelves.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Freshness, tastiness and flavour. You can’t get better than picking it yourself.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Knowing where your food comes from. Today too many people think it comes from a carton or made in a factory; if you come to the farm you can see the fruit and vegetables growing and learn about how they grow.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Zero food miles. With PYO you know they haven’t traveled around the world or been transported miles in lorries around the country.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It’s fun! As we grow our strawberries on “tables”, it’s great for all the family whether old or young, as there is no bending down.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n<h3><a href=\\"http://www.aldercarrfarm.co.uk/\\">Alder Carr Farm in Ipswich</a></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Which fruits can I pick here? </strong>Strawberries<strong>, </strong>blueberries, cherries, raspberries.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>What </strong><strong>else can I do here? </strong>There are animals on the farm that the kids will love to look at and a small nature trail.

            \'safe_value\' => "<p>\\"Pick your own\\" is a cheap and fun way to entertain the kids and the whole family! For the little ones, is the thrill of picking their own fruit straight from the plant, and for us grown ups, the enjoyment of making homemade ice creams, cakes and jam. You can\'t beat the taste of fresh picked fruit! Strawberry season in Suffolk starts, depending on the weather, either at the end of May or June. We asked <a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/GoslingsFarmGardenCafe?fref=ts\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Goslings Farm </a>about their \\"PYO experience\\" and they had a few words of advice:</p>\\n<h3>What are your tips on picking the best strawberries?</h3>\\n<p>Check they are ripe and red all the way round, Strawberries ripen nearest the sun/light first, and  they have more flavour and sweetness when they are ripe. Also at our PYO, everyone picks the 1st plant they come to!!, so it’s best to go to the other end and the outside rows for the best strawberries!! Select firm, fully red berries. Strawberries DO NOT continue to ripen after they are picked! In the photo, only the berry on the far right is completely ripe.</p>\\n<h3>Why would you recommend \\"pick your own\\" rather than buying them in supermarkets?</h3>\\n<p>There are many reasons to pick your own rather than just buying them from the shelves.</p>\\n<ul><li>Freshness, tastiness and flavour. You can’t get better than picking it yourself.</li>\\n<li>Knowing where your food comes from. Today too many people think it comes from a carton or made in a factory; if you come to the farm you can see the fruit and vegetables growing and learn about how they grow.</li>\\n<li>Zero food miles. With PYO you know they haven’t traveled around the world or been transported miles in lorries around the country.</li>\\n<li>It’s fun! As we grow our strawberries on “tables”, it’s great for all the family whether old or young, as there is no bending down.</li>\\n</ul><h3><a href=\\"http://www.aldercarrfarm.co.uk/\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Alder Carr Farm in Ipswich</a></h3>\\n<ul><li><strong>Which fruits can I pick here? </strong>Strawberries<strong>, </strong>blueberries, cherries, raspberries.</li>\\n<li><strong>What </strong><strong>else can I do here? </strong>There are animals on the farm that the kids will love to look at and a small nature trail.

Come along to this 2 day festival and discover the wacky and whimsical world of <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/event/longshop-steampunk-spectacular-weekend-11-12-july\\">steampunk</a>. It embraces an aesthetic and an ethos of innovation, elegance and creative flair! There will be stalls, activities and entertainment for enthusiasts and novices alike as well as engines in steam with an opportunity for rides on our very own Sirapite – something for everyone to enjoy.</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Designer-makers will be represented at the <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/event/longshop-steampunk-spectacular-weekend-11-12-july\\">Steampunk </a>market with a unique range of clothing, jewelry and paraphernalia for retro geek chic, avant-garde artisan creations and more. Book signers will be armed with pens, duelists will be in combat with an arsenal of biscuits and a proper cuppa to compete in the ‘Tea Duels’. Brollies will also be at the ready for our Umbrella fencers – an engaging spectacle of light footed and quick handed skills and if that’s not energetic enough there will be demonstrations of Bartitsu the ancient martial art made famous by Sherlock Holmes. Throughout the weekend there will be spellbinding stories abound with Truelove Tours providing ‘Tales from Leopold Thorn’ and there will be magic in the air from ‘Nothing Up Our Sleeves’. We have comedy along with some great live music on Saturday evening from Metropolis – the maestros of our 2014 event - making a magnificent come-back. And if that gets your thirst up, cream teas and other culinary treats will be available for your delectation. The gorgeous Sirapite engine will be on show in full steam and this promises to be a delightfully diverse festival. The Long Shop Museum provides a perfect backdrop for a movement which celebrates Victorian technology with a 21st Century twist.

Goggles and gadgets, corsets and cream teas, music, magic and mysterious machinations.  <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/event/longshop-steampunk-spectacular-weekend-11-12-july\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Steampunk </a>will make a spectacular return to Suffolk in July 2015 when the Long Shop will become a museum of curiosities and a thriving hub of neo-Victorian wonder! Come along to this 2 day festival and discover the wacky and whimsical world of <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/event/longshop-steampunk-spectacular-weekend-11-12-july\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">steampunk</a>. It embraces an aesthetic and an ethos of innovation, elegance and creative flair! There will be stalls, activities and entertainment for enthusiasts and novices alike as well as engines in steam with an opportunity for rides on our very own Sirapite – something for everyone to enjoy.</h5>\\n<p>Designer-makers will be represented at the <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/event/longshop-steampunk-spectacular-weekend-11-12-july\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Steampunk </a>market with a unique range of clothing, jewelry and paraphernalia for retro geek chic, avant-garde artisan creations and more. Book signers will be armed with pens, duelists will be in combat with an arsenal of biscuits and a proper cuppa to compete in the ‘Tea Duels’. Brollies will also be at the ready for our Umbrella fencers – an engaging spectacle of light footed and quick handed skills and if that’s not energetic enough there will be demonstrations of Bartitsu the ancient martial art made famous by Sherlock Holmes. Throughout the weekend there will be spellbinding stories abound with Truelove Tours providing ‘Tales from Leopold Thorn’ and there will be magic in the air from ‘Nothing Up Our Sleeves’. We have comedy along with some great live music on Saturday evening from Metropolis – the maestros of our 2014 event - making a magnificent come-back. And if that gets your thirst up, cream teas and other culinary treats will be available for your delectation. The gorgeous Sirapite engine will be on show in full steam and this promises to be a delightfully diverse festival. The Long Shop Museum provides a perfect backdrop for a movement which celebrates Victorian technology with a 21st Century twist.

Come as you are, or come in Victorian/ Edwardian dress to join in the spirit of the event. No need to book – just come along! Normal Museum admission charges apply. From Saturday 28th, the Museum will be open 7 days per week throughout the school Easter holidays – please 10-5 Mon-Sat, <strong>11-3</strong> on Sundays (please not new Sunday opening times) – and there will be an ‘egg hunt’ quiz trail and other family activities available – please check the Museum website or phone the Museum (01728 832189) for updated details.  <a href=\\"http://www.longshopmuseum.co.uk\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">www.longshopmuseum.co.uk</a>.</p>\\n<h2>For more fun family events take a look at our <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/events/\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">calendar of events</a></h2>\\n<h3> </h3>\\n",

There are two car parks, one on each side of the lake and they are both free for as long as you want. Usually we park up at the first car park we reach (Ipswich&nbsp;side) which has a large grassed area that is great for football/games etc. There is also a ‘den’ that has been formed by a group of trees that the kids spend ages playing in.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are several picnic benches around, a kiosk (open at weekends and during school holidays) that sells cold drinks and ice-creams, and a large play area suitable for all ages. &nbsp; Before any of this however we usually get Joe’s bike or scooter out and head off for a trip around the lake. To reach the lake from this side you take a footbridge that crosses the river adjacent to the lake, you can then follow the footpath that runs all the way around the lake.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For those with small children be warned, you have to keep a close eye on the kids as there are no barriers around the edge of the water. I would describe the lake as ‘medium’ size, it takes about half an hour to walk all the way round at a leisurely pace, but there are a few things for the kids to see and do along the way, like den building, climbing logs, sculptures etc. There are also quite a few resting points along the way with wooden benches scattered around. We always see a&nbsp;few fishermen dotted around the lake as well so if you’re into fishing it’d be worth finding out the rules/cost etc but I don’t personally know the fishing etiquette! &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our son also loves the fact that on one side of the lake you are close to the railway –&nbsp;Needham&nbsp;station is next to the lake on the&nbsp;Needham&nbsp;side, so the kids love it when the trains speed past. On the&nbsp;Needham&nbsp;side of the lake, where the other car park is, there is a block of public toilets that are very handy, although not overly clean. There is another smaller play area on this side, probably more suitable for younger kids, and a few more picnic benches. We usually stop here for a play and to feed the ducks. There is also a launching platform for the model boat club so we often see people from the club with boats out on the water – or you can take your own of course. &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are seasonal car boot sales held twice a week in the large field next to the car park (Ipswich&nbsp;side), on Sunday &amp; Wednesday mornings. These are quite large and very popular and hence the lake/car parks get very busy at these times. &nbsp; In addition, a few events are held at the lake throughout the year. This year we went when the annual raft races were taking place in June which was a fun event involving several teams in fancy dress racing on the lake in their home-made rafts! There was also a small funfair on that occasion.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Verdict</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is a lovely place to go in all weathers for a walk, cycle, scoot and play and if it’s warm enough it’s a very nice place to stop for a picnic.

So why not come and explore a bit more?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Farm Nature Trail</strong><br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe route begins at the car park inbetween the gravel garden and farm animals and goes down a track past our pond. Please don\'t go off the marked route, if you need directions please ask in the farm shop.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<strong>Please Note:</strong><br />\\r\\nThe trail goes through some very wet areas including ponds, ditches and wet meadows so please bring your wellies. The area is also prone to mosquitos so long sleeves and mosquito repellant are advised. Sorry but we can\'t allow dogs on the trail. Children must be accompanied by an adult at all times.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nEnjoy your walk!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Farm Animals</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n<div>We have been keeping animals on the farm since we opened in 1981 and feel they are an improtant aspect of farming. They allow us to use parts of the farm which are unsuitable for cropping. They help improve the health of the soil by adding nutrients so we don\'t have to use as many artificial fertilisers and they also help increase the fields biodiversity.</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Red Poll cattle</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div>As champions of local produce and provenance, we\'ve replaced our original Highland Cattle herd with Red Poll cattle, the traditional Suffolk and Norfolk breed which is enjoying a resurgence in popularity.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nFamed for its good quality beef as well as dairy, and recognisable from its deep red hide with white touches on the tail and udder, our herd has also produced several new calves this spring.&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n<h3>Free-range hens<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAll our free-range hens are the Tradition Lohmann breed which is a hardy hybrid which lays brown eggs.

So why not come and explore a bit more?</p>\\n<p><strong>Farm Nature Trail</strong></p>\\n<p>The route begins at the car park inbetween the gravel garden and farm animals and goes down a track past our pond. Please don\'t go off the marked route, if you need directions please ask in the farm shop.</p>\\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><br />\\nThe trail goes through some very wet areas including ponds, ditches and wet meadows so please bring your wellies. The area is also prone to mosquitos so long sleeves and mosquito repellant are advised. Sorry but we can\'t allow dogs on the trail. Children must be accompanied by an adult at all times.</p>\\n<p>Enjoy your walk!</p>\\n<h2>Farm Animals</h2>\\n<p>We have been keeping animals on the farm since we opened in 1981 and feel they are an improtant aspect of farming. They allow us to use parts of the farm which are unsuitable for cropping. They help improve the health of the soil by adding nutrients so we don\'t have to use as many artificial fertilisers and they also help increase the fields biodiversity.</p>\\n<h3>Red Poll cattle</h3>\\n<p>As champions of local produce and provenance, we\'ve replaced our original Highland Cattle herd with Red Poll cattle, the traditional Suffolk and Norfolk breed which is enjoying a resurgence in popularity.</p>\\n<p>Famed for its good quality beef as well as dairy, and recognisable from its deep red hide with white touches on the tail and udder, our herd has also produced several new calves this spring. </p>\\n<h3>Free-range hens\\n</h3><p>All our free-range hens are the Tradition Lohmann breed which is a hardy hybrid which lays brown eggs. The eggs are for sale in the farm shop throughout the year.\\n</p>",

We close at 3pm when there is no evening performance and on Sunday\'s and Bank Holiday\'s we\'ll be open 2 hours before the performance.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>So whether you\'re popping in to book a ticket or heading into to town to shop, the theatre is a pleasant place to enjoy morning coffee and lunch – and, of course, it’s ideal when you are seeing a show, especially if you\'re taking advantage of our new pre-show menu.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You can choose from:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An excellent range of freshly prepared rolls, sandwiches &amp; panini\'s, which change daily and seasonally</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Homemade soups</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Jacket Potatoes with a variety of fillings</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Fair-trade, Rainforest Alliance &amp; Organic Coffee</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>A wide range of hot and cold drinks including syrups for the adventurous</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>All New Wolsey Café Bar produce is sourced from local suppliers and businesses and we\'re fully WiFi enabled too.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Acess</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Audio Description</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Audio Described performances give you a live commentary about the action happening on the stage through a pair of small headphones. It’s a great way for anyone who finds it difficult to see the details of a performance to still enjoy coming to the theatre.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If you use television audio description, a magnifier or large print books at home then live audio description means you can enjoy a theatre outing with your friends and family.To help you immerse yourselves in the show as much as possible we offer touch tours before each audio-described performance enabling you to explore the stage and get a feel of the set and costumes before the play starts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We recommend Audio Description headsets are pre-booked at the Box Office for a returnable deposit of £10.00.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>British Sign Language</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>During a British Sign Language (BSL) Interpreted performance an interpreter stands on or at the side of the stage, clearly visible to the audience, and interprets the spoken word and sound effects for Deaf patrons who use BSL.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Ensure you tell the box office you are booking to use the interpreter and they will seat you appropriately.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Captioning</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Captioning converts the spoken word into text that provides people with hearing loss access to live performance. In captioning, the words appear on a screen at the same time as they are sung or spoken.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Captioning is a great way for anyone who finds it difficult to hear the actors speaking to still enjoy coming to the theatre. You may hear most things but if you need to see people’s faces to follow a conversation or struggle with certain voices, accents or styles of speaking. You will see the words spoken by the performers displayed as text on a screen on or next to the stage. You will also see the name of the character who is speaking and a description of any sound effects. It’s a bit like television subtitles.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>People who are studying classic texts or want to improve their English may also find captioning useful.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Relaxed Performances</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A Relaxed Performance is one which has been carefully adjusted to reduce anxiety or stress for those who might otherwise find the experience unsettling or difficult.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For example, someone with autism, sensory and communication needs and/or a learning disability might be reluctant for a variety of reasons to attend public theatre performances. Relaxed performances are a fantastic way to offer families the chance to experience theatre together. In a Relaxed Performance, the audience benefit from a relaxed environment as the performance is adjusted to reduce anxiety or stress, for example changes are made to sound and lighting to eliminate surprise and soften their impact. There is a relaxed attitude to noise and moving around the auditorium during the performance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Audience members always have the option to watch the show on plasma screen in the bar if being in the auditorium becomes overwhelming. We introduced relaxed performances as an extra option for audiences and to remove barriers to access and enjoyment. It\'s about making the theatre welcoming and inclusive for all.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The auditorium is accessible from the street without encountering any steps. Row C is accessible from the Ground Floor Foyer without using steps, and Row K also, via the passenger lift to the Bar area on the first floor. Guide dogs are welcome throughout the building and, if you prefer, we will happily look after your dog whilst you watch the performance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Venue</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The theatre is accessible from the street without encountering any steps. The front doors to the theatre are newly automated for easy access.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Auditorium</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Row C and Row K are accessible without encountering any steps. For each subsequent row there are two steps. There are four spaces available for wheelchair users in the auditorium, two in Row C and two in Row K. Click here to view seating plans where accessible seating is indicated in yellow.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Outlets &amp; Amenities</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Box Office is located inside the main entrance.

We close at 3pm when there is no evening performance and on Sunday\'s and Bank Holiday\'s we\'ll be open 2 hours before the performance.</li>\\n<li>So whether you\'re popping in to book a ticket or heading into to town to shop, the theatre is a pleasant place to enjoy morning coffee and lunch – and, of course, it’s ideal when you are seeing a show, especially if you\'re taking advantage of our new pre-show menu.</li>\\n</ul><p>You can choose from:</p>\\n<p>An excellent range of freshly prepared rolls, sandwiches &amp; panini\'s, which change daily and seasonally</p>\\n<ul><li>Homemade soups</li>\\n<li>Jacket Potatoes with a variety of fillings</li>\\n<li>Fair-trade, Rainforest Alliance &amp; Organic Coffee</li>\\n<li>A wide range of hot and cold drinks including syrups for the adventurous</li>\\n<li>All New Wolsey Café Bar produce is sourced from local suppliers and businesses and we\'re fully WiFi enabled too.</li>\\n</ul><h3><strong>Acess</strong></h3>\\n<h4><strong>Audio Description</strong></h4>\\n<p>Audio Described performances give you a live commentary about the action happening on the stage through a pair of small headphones. It’s a great way for anyone who finds it difficult to see the details of a performance to still enjoy coming to the theatre.</p>\\n<p>If you use television audio description, a magnifier or large print books at home then live audio description means you can enjoy a theatre outing with your friends and family.To help you immerse yourselves in the show as much as possible we offer touch tours before each audio-described performance enabling you to explore the stage and get a feel of the set and costumes before the play starts.</p>\\n<p>We recommend Audio Description headsets are pre-booked at the Box Office for a returnable deposit of £10.00.</p>\\n<h4><strong>British Sign Language</strong></h4>\\n<p>During a British Sign Language (BSL) Interpreted performance an interpreter stands on or at the side of the stage, clearly visible to the audience, and interprets the spoken word and sound effects for Deaf patrons who use BSL.</p>\\n<p>Ensure you tell the box office you are booking to use the interpreter and they will seat you appropriately.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Captioning</strong></h4>\\n<p>Captioning converts the spoken word into text that provides people with hearing loss access to live performance. In captioning, the words appear on a screen at the same time as they are sung or spoken.</p>\\n<p>Captioning is a great way for anyone who finds it difficult to hear the actors speaking to still enjoy coming to the theatre. You may hear most things but if you need to see people’s faces to follow a conversation or struggle with certain voices, accents or styles of speaking. You will see the words spoken by the performers displayed as text on a screen on or next to the stage. You will also see the name of the character who is speaking and a description of any sound effects. It’s a bit like television subtitles.</p>\\n<p>People who are studying classic texts or want to improve their English may also find captioning useful.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Relaxed Performances</strong></h4>\\n<p>A Relaxed Performance is one which has been carefully adjusted to reduce anxiety or stress for those who might otherwise find the experience unsettling or difficult.</p>\\n<p>For example, someone with autism, sensory and communication needs and/or a learning disability might be reluctant for a variety of reasons to attend public theatre performances. Relaxed performances are a fantastic way to offer families the chance to experience theatre together. In a Relaxed Performance, the audience benefit from a relaxed environment as the performance is adjusted to reduce anxiety or stress, for example changes are made to sound and lighting to eliminate surprise and soften their impact. There is a relaxed attitude to noise and moving around the auditorium during the performance.</p>\\n<p>Audience members always have the option to watch the show on plasma screen in the bar if being in the auditorium becomes overwhelming. We introduced relaxed performances as an extra option for audiences and to remove barriers to access and enjoyment. It\'s about making the theatre welcoming and inclusive for all.</p>\\n<p>The auditorium is accessible from the street without encountering any steps. Row C is accessible from the Ground Floor Foyer without using steps, and Row K also, via the passenger lift to the Bar area on the first floor. Guide dogs are welcome throughout the building and, if you prefer, we will happily look after your dog whilst you watch the performance.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Venue</strong></h3>\\n<p>The theatre is accessible from the street without encountering any steps. The front doors to the theatre are newly automated for easy access.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Auditorium</strong></h4>\\n<p>Row C and Row K are accessible without encountering any steps. For each subsequent row there are two steps. There are four spaces available for wheelchair users in the auditorium, two in Row C and two in Row K. Click here to view seating plans where accessible seating is indicated in yellow.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Outlets &amp; Amenities</strong></h4>\\n<p>The Box Office is located inside the main entrance. It has a low level service counter and an induction hearing loop system – to use turn your hearing aid to T. There is one accessible toilet on the ground floor near the Café Bar and one in the Bar on the first floor.

A year ago youngsters of all ages from across West Suffolk and beyond celebrated the official opening of the new skate park at the annual Skate Jam. The skate boarding community had raised £100,000 and been involved in selecting the equipment and layout of the skate park, while St Edmundsbury met the remaining £150,000 needed to complete the scheme. Now youngsters are back fundraising – this time towards £10,000 to upgrade the lighting at the skate park <strong>through a skate jam and live music on 22 May.</strong> Simon Pickering, youth and community development officer at St Edmundsbury Borough Council was involved in the skate park project. He said: “Last year’s Skate Jam was a fantastic curtain raiser and the new skate park has continued to be popular with the ever growing skate boarding community we have in and around Bury. The new skate park was their investment, the skate boarders, BMX riders, scooter users and skaters all bought into it, helping to raise money and choose the equipment they wanted. Now they are continuing that work by fundraising toward improved lighting that will enable them to use the skate park for longer as well as during those dark winter evenings.” Elle Zwandahl is chairperson of the Bury Skate Park Experience charity which was set up to raise money for the new skate park through grant applications and fundraising. She said: “This is the evolution of the Bury skate park. A year has rolled by and the skate park is ever popular, promoting healthy lifestyle, exercise, and fresh air. It is part of the rich heritage of Bury. Now the youngsters are taking ownership and are raising funds for further improvements that will only enhance their ability to use this brilliant facility. It is to be commended and admired, and I am looking forward to this year’s Skate Rock and BMX Pop night. I am sure it will be a very successful event.” Sean Butler, a trustee of the Bury Skate Park Experience said: \\"It\'s amazing to be a part of something that bought me so much pleasure throughout my youth and still does to this very day. The skatepark is one of the most important youth facilities in the town, it\'s great to see young people taking hold of what they have and wanting to improve it. Everyone is looking forward to what is sure to be a very entertaining event and excited for others in the future.\\" Skate Rock and BMX Pop 2 takes place from 7pm to 11pm at the skate park in Olding Road with live music from Horse Party, Tryal of Witches and The Virtues.

The event is also returning to three days, which carnival vice-chairman Tim Brame said was a result of the success of the two previous years. Mr Brame said Dr Feelgood were interrupting their performances in Europe to perform in Stowmarket. “I feel pleased about that really. I made initial contact with them as I’m a bit of a Feelgood fan myself and told them what the carnival was about. “I got a call back from Kevin Morris (the drummer), and they were keen to come to Stowmarket and support our event and get the weekend started in a feelgood way, in the words he used. “To get them to take a break from Europe is a bit of an honour really. “We’re only a small town event. “The committee is all excited about it and we want to share that excitement with the public.” He added: “Another big introduction this year is Jazznic, which sees jazz on the Sunday afternoon, with an invitation to those attending to bring their own picnics to enjoy on the grass.” Scheduled to perform as part of the Jazznic are Nick Raison, Olivia Stone and Natasha and The Jazz Bizarre. Mr Brame said: “It’s looking good. It’s looking to be the biggest event in the 54 years it’s been running.” The organisers are also looking to try and build some surplus funds that can be provided in the form of grants for groups within the community. Mr Brame said: “The chairman, Paul Morris, is also quite keen to have a charitable aspect.” On the Saturday local bands will be showcased, and the Jazznic will begin after the carnival procession, the theme of which is sport. “Hopefully the Jazznic will pull people in from out of the area, just for the jazz,” he added. “Sport is such a wide and varied subject. It could be sports from the past and sports from far off shores. “Last year was such a positive atmosphere, and the numbers through the gates were through the roof. “We had about 13,000 over both days. “This year hopefully we can crack that.” The organisers are also looking for a sponsor for the stage this year. Mr Brame said because Dr Feelgood were playing, organisers had opted for a stage as opposed to a lorry trailer, which had been used in previous years.

To say we had a few laughs would be an understatement. If you are taking photos with your camera there is a great FREE photo editor on-line called <a href=\\"http://www.fotor.com/\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Fotor </a> just upload your photo to give it a vintage feel. Here is a compilation of vintage poses which I found very handy during the photo-shoot. If you do decide to organize a mystery dinner party let me know how it went! </p>\\n<h2> </h2>\\n<p>                     </p>\\n",

However, as the Regatta was on we were unable to hire a boat as the lake was being used for boat races, so I can’t tell you the exact cost but it’s in the region of £20 for 4 people to take a boat out for 2 hours.

There is also a shop selling all sorts of things from snacks, drinks and ice-creams, to bucket &amp; spades and crabbing gear, and a café selling hot and cold food with plenty of outside seating overlooking the lake. There are public toilets near the lake and the other side of the shop was another green which had a few rides and stalls set up – I expect these were just there for the regatta week.

Routes around the park vary from a thirty minutes stroll to a one hour walk on the circular path on the perimeter of the park. Dogs are welcome but must be kept on a lead.

The Nowton Park totem pole stands 35.4 feet (10.8m) tall near the centre of the North American region of the arboretum. It is carved from a western red cedar which is&nbsp;the species traditionally favoured by Native Americans for their totem poles.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The bird feeding area</strong><br />\\r\\nTo your left when looking towards the main house from the lime avenue, you will see the bird feeding station on the edge of the wood. In the winter a variety of woodland birds can be seen&nbsp;such&nbsp;as&nbsp;the&nbsp;blue, great and long tailed tit, nuthatch and the great spotted woodpecker. The wood around the bird feeding area is known as Cherry Glade. It is a larch plantation also containing cherry and sweet chestnut as well as a few fine specimen oaks. In this area there is a good example of a mature larch, the only European conifer that loses its needles in winter. There are also mature beech and oak growing in the nearby pasture.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The lime avenue</strong><br />\\r\\nThe lime avenue is one of the finest examples in the UK and was planted around 1880 to give the estate a sense of grandeur and to provide the house (then Nowton Court) with a vista to the northern boundary. Unusually, it did not mark the main entrance route to the house. In spring&nbsp;over 100,000 daffodils bloom beneath the trees. These were planted in 1989, the two species planted were King Alfred and Magnificent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The maze</strong><br />\\r\\nYou can lose yourself in the maze which is in the shape of a stylised oak tree (in commemoration of the Oakes family who were the former estate owners). The maze is open from May to October every year and is south of the park, 2km from the main car park. There are 2,500 hornbeam trees that make up over two miles of hedging, maintained at a height of around two metres. Hornbeam is similar to beech and keeps its leaves through the winter. The centre of the maze is marked by a fastigiate oak (with upright branches).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The ponds</strong><br />\\r\\nThere are two ponds in Nowton Park - the meadow pond which is rich in aquatic life and is a draw for grass snakes as a place to bask, hunt and swim. There is also the school pond so called&nbsp;because&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;near&nbsp;the&nbsp;manor&nbsp;house&nbsp;which&nbsp;was&nbsp;used&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;prep&nbsp;school&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;war.

The main forest entrance is easy to find, by taking the B1084 Woodbridge to Orford road and following the road signs. The entrance takes you into a large car park, around which all the facilities are based.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You do have to pay for parking but this is the only unavoidable expense, and at about £3 for the day it is well worth it. Once you are parked up you can explore the forest as you wish. As soon as Joe spotted the first play area he rushed off to have a go. This was a large climbing frame with a great twisting enclosed slide and it’s easily accessible for all ages, although very little ones may need some help. Once we had finally persuaded Joe to move onto something else we got the bikes out of the car and decided to set of on a bike ride.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are free leaflets by the parking ticket machine showing you what trails are available to suit your cycling ability. Basically, there are two walking trails (0.75 &amp; 3 miles) and two cycle trails (6 &amp; 10 miles), all of which are colour coded and can be easily followed by tracing the coloured marker posts along the way. This did however present us with a problem – our son is not yet 4 and has only just taken his stabilisers off, there is no way he would manage a 6 mile cycle ride! However, it seemed a real shame not to have a go so instead we started off with the short walking trail.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As it says on the leaflet this is not strictly allowed, but fortunately nobody seemed to mind. Both of the cycle trails are classified as ‘easy’ and are suitable for beginners, as long as you can manage the distance, or can successfully switch to the long walking trail as a shortcut back to the start. We took our own bikes although there is a bike hire shop on the site with a variety of bikes for hire – we can’t comment on prices though as we didn’t use them. In addition to these trails there is also a special ‘UFO Trail’, which is 3 miles long. This is designed to give you an insight into the 1980’s alleged UFO sightings, so you can see the areas involved, read the story, consider the reports and decide whether the mystery is true….kids (and grown ups) interested in the paranormal will be in their element.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>After the cycle ride we got a hot drink from the kiosk (not great quality, I’d recommend taking a flask!), and sat and ate our packed lunch. The kiosk also sells cold drinks and ice creams. There are lots of picnic benches scattered around and also a big open space of grass where you can sit with a picnic blanket.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are also toilet facilities that were kept clean. After our lunch we explored the other play areas that are all within easy walking distance, our son loved them all but a few were for older children so he needed a bit of help. There was a zip wire (age 5+ but Joe was able to have a go), lots of things to climb on, den building, swings, games and more.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This really is a wonderful active day out for kids of all ages, but ages 4-10 would probably get the most out of it. The forest is beautiful and if you go on a lovely sunny day and take a picnic then you can spend a w hole day there for very little cost. The forest trails are great for walking and cycling enthusiasts. There is plenty to keep the kids occupied and they are guaranteed to go home exhausted and happy!

This year’s event features bagpipes, Bollywood dance, panpipes, Chinese children\'s dragon dance workshop, polish songs, recorder music and tribal belly dance. There will also be children’s craft activities, world food and craft stalls, a pop-up café’, a fashion show and information stands from multicultural community groups from across Ipswich. The event runs from 10.30am to 3.30pm and anyone is welcome to drop in to the library throughout the day. The event has been running for the past few years and has developed into a very popular celebration and a great way of bring people from different communities in Ipswich together. Helen Milne at Ipswich Library who takes a key role in coordinating the event, said: “Our Multicultural Day celebrates the diverse local community and is a free and fun-filled event bringing the people of Ipswich together. There are usually over a thousand visitors to the library throughout the day and I hope more people will drop in this year to enjoy the activities and there will be plenty of opportunities to join in.” This will be the first year that members of the library’s Chat n’ Chill group have performed. The Chat n’ Chill sessions run twice a week for women who do not speak English as their first language. Staff from Ipswich Library work with various local groups including people from India, Africa, Zimbabwe, Poland, Afghanistan, Romania, Lithuania, Russia and China. Ipswich Library has also worked with the Anglo Chinese Cultural Exchange to deliver Mandarin classes at the library and helps many people with their British Citizenship information. <a href=\\"Ipswich%20Library’s multicultural celebration\\">Ipswich Library’s multicultural celebration</a> &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n",

            \'value\' => "<p>I\'ve attended many <a href=\\"http://www.redrosechain.com/\\">Red Rose Chain</a> productions in the past, including their early Theatre in the Forest shows in <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/places/woodbridge/outdoor-activities/rendelsham-forest\\">Rendlesham Forest</a>, but haven\'t managed to get to a performance since becoming a mum back in 2008. Needless to say I was a little bit excited to have the opportunity to go along to A Midsummer Night\'s Dream at <a href=\\"http://jimmysfarm.com/events/\\">Jimmy\'s Farm</a> this week, especially as this time I was able to take my nearly-seven-year-old along with me. Like many children he does enjoy the performing arts, and has sat engrossed through a good number of children\'s plays, pantomimes, dance renditions and musicals at places like <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/places/ipswich/indoor-activities/the-new-wolsey-theatre\\">The New Wolsey</a>, <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/places/ipswich/indoor-activities/ipswich-regent-theatre-corn-exchange\\">The Regent</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/places/ipswich/indoor-activities/danceeast\\">Dance East</a>&nbsp;over the years, but I have to admit I hadn\'t yet exposed him to Shakespeare!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To be fair, initially he was mostly just excited because he was getting to stay up late and we would be outside in the woods after dark. But as we made our way towards the seating area, ducking through trees laden with fairy lights, the magical feeling started to set in. We had arrived in plenty of time (unusual for me!), so after bagging our seats we headed off to find Fairyland - a lovely little area of the wood designed to get younger visitors in the mood for magic and mystery - find the four fairy doors to win a special badge!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;Presumably because this was a weekday performance, the audience on this particular night was mainly adults. There were still quite a few children there too though, mostly in the 6 years plus age range, and even a tiny baby all snuggly in warm blankets. All were made more than welcome, and those that there brave enough to sit on the floor right in front of the stage even had brief moments of involvement with the performance. Personally I was pleased to be sitting further back on the staged seating, sufficiently far away from the \\"action\\" but still with a great view of the stage even for the little ones.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As always, the performance itself was witty and original, incorporating Red Rose Chain\'s unique brand of drama, music, comedy and costume with the time-honoured story-telling and humour of William Shakespeare - a winning combination if ever there was one!

            \'safe_value\' => "<p>I\'ve attended many <a href=\\"http://www.redrosechain.com/\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Red Rose Chain</a> productions in the past, including their early Theatre in the Forest shows in <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/places/woodbridge/outdoor-activities/rendelsham-forest\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Rendlesham Forest</a>, but haven\'t managed to get to a performance since becoming a mum back in 2008. Needless to say I was a little bit excited to have the opportunity to go along to A Midsummer Night\'s Dream at <a href=\\"http://jimmysfarm.com/events/\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Jimmy\'s Farm</a> this week, especially as this time I was able to take my nearly-seven-year-old along with me. Like many children he does enjoy the performing arts, and has sat engrossed through a good number of children\'s plays, pantomimes, dance renditions and musicals at places like <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/places/ipswich/indoor-activities/the-new-wolsey-theatre\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">The New Wolsey</a>, <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/places/ipswich/indoor-activities/ipswich-regent-theatre-corn-exchange\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">The Regent</a> and <a href=\\"http://wheretotakeourchildren.co.uk/places/ipswich/indoor-activities/danceeast\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Dance East</a> over the years, but I have to admit I hadn\'t yet exposed him to Shakespeare!</p>\\n<p>To be fair, initially he was mostly just excited because he was getting to stay up late and we would be outside in the woods after dark. But as we made our way towards the seating area, ducking through trees laden with fairy lights, the magical feeling started to set in. We had arrived in plenty of time (unusual for me!), so after bagging our seats we headed off to find Fairyland - a lovely little area of the wood designed to get younger visitors in the mood for magic and mystery - find the four fairy doors to win a special badge!</p>\\n<p> Presumably because this was a weekday performance, the audience on this particular night was mainly adults. There were still quite a few children there too though, mostly in the 6 years plus age range, and even a tiny baby all snuggly in warm blankets. All were made more than welcome, and those that there brave enough to sit on the floor right in front of the stage even had brief moments of involvement with the performance. Personally I was pleased to be sitting further back on the staged seating, sufficiently far away from the \\"action\\" but still with a great view of the stage even for the little ones.</p>\\n<p>As always, the performance itself was witty and original, incorporating Red Rose Chain\'s unique brand of drama, music, comedy and costume with the time-honoured story-telling and humour of William Shakespeare - a winning combination if ever there was one! I was a little concerned that the language would go over my son\'s head (there\'s plenty of places where it goes over mine!), and although he did look a bit bemused at first there was always enough going on to keep his attention throughout.</p>\\n<p>It was well worth buying a program too, as at the back is a breakdown of the characters and the key story points, told in simple language and brilliantly illustrated with cartoons - that really helped with explaining what was going on and where we were in the story (and I\'m not ashamed to admit that it helped me too!)

The concert will feature War Horse author Michael Morpurgo reading from his short story <em>The Best Christmas Present in the World.</em> To win one of these family tickets Suffolk Libraries is asking children to write a letter to Michael Morpurgo explaining what their ‘Best Christmas Present in the World’ would be. The winners will also receive a signed copy of <em>The Best Christmas Present in the World</em> and will get a chance to meet Michael Morpurgo to give him their letters after the performance. The former Children’s Laureate will be accompanied by the renowned stage and screen actress Virginia McKenna and the six-piece acapella group Voices at the Door who will be singing Christmas carols from Britain, France and Flanders. The competition is open for any Suffolk children aged under 16. Entries should be less than 200 words and should be emailed to <a href=\\"mailto:competition@suffolklibraries.co.uk\\">competition@suffolklibraries.co.uk</a> or handed in to any branch of Suffolk Libraries (with contact details attached). The competition closes on Thursday 5 November at 5pm. The winners will be selected and notified on Friday 6 November 2015. The two winning entries will each receive a family ticket (2 adults and 2 children) for the event at St Edmundsbury Cathedral at 7pm on 18th November. <em>The Best Christmas Present in the World</em>, is a moving short-story of a young soldier named Jim and his personal account of the famous World War One Christmas Truce of 1914 in which an unforgettable football match took place in No-Man’s Land between the British and German troops. A century on from this landmark event, a soldier’s letter is found by chance in an antique desk - “Jim’s Last Letter: to be buried with me when the time comes.” And thus begins the quest to find his “Dearest Connie”. Tickets for the event are £15 for adults, £8 for children and £40 for a family ticket (2 adults and 2 children) and are available from Waterstones Bury St Edmunds Butter Market (01284 750877) or Waterstones Bury St Edmunds Arc Centre (01284 750726) and <a href=\\"http://www.waterstones.com/events\\">www.waterstones.com/events</a></p>\\r\\n",

There will also be pin badge and sweets making sessions, the chance to try out some Edwardian Fire Fighting techniques as well as the opportunity to meet Frank Garrett and find out about Edwardian life at the works and potential ‘trouble at mill!’ Our previous “Make it Work Day’ saw the museum abuzz with families ‘making it work’ by getting stuck into a range of satisfying practical projects. The opportunity is there for only one more week as next Wednesday 19th August is our final ‘MIW’ Day. Stimulating technical challenges include finding out how to hold a bucket of water upside down and not get wet, playing with our ‘quick sand gloop, and other hands on activities! This runs from 1pm to 3.30pm. Activities on both days are included with the standard admission price. Two down and only two to go – not to missed!&nbsp; The Long Shop Trails are also still in operation for budding sleuths to track down various items and secrets on any day of the week. 50p per trail plus normal admission.

There will also be pin badge and sweets making sessions, the chance to try out some Edwardian Fire Fighting techniques as well as the opportunity to meet Frank Garrett and find out about Edwardian life at the works and potential ‘trouble at mill!’ Our previous “Make it Work Day’ saw the museum abuzz with families ‘making it work’ by getting stuck into a range of satisfying practical projects. The opportunity is there for only one more week as next Wednesday 19th August is our final ‘MIW’ Day. Stimulating technical challenges include finding out how to hold a bucket of water upside down and not get wet, playing with our ‘quick sand gloop, and other hands on activities! This runs from 1pm to 3.30pm. Activities on both days are included with the standard admission price. Two down and only two to go – not to missed!  The Long Shop Trails are also still in operation for budding sleuths to track down various items and secrets on any day of the week. 50p per trail plus normal admission. For details of these and other events at the museum, see  <a href=\\"http://www.longshopmuseum.co.uk\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">www.longshopmuseum.co.uk</a></p>\\n",

You will be able to pick up some great plants and have a chance to meet our bees as well as getting involved with pond-dipping and bug-hunting.&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we are celebrating the ‘Year of the Sunflower’, so feel free to dress according to the theme! On the green sward, Suffolk Police will be taking centre stage with their tractor and patrol car, and you will also be able to meet Suffolk Fire &amp; Rescue Service with their fire engine. Children can have a go at circus skills and get their face painted – another chance to look like a sunflower or perhaps a lizard or snake! Maidenhall Allotments Association will have their usual impressive array of produce, cakes and jams, and there will be a host of stalls and activities, including crafts and jewellery. There will also be the opportunity to pick up a prize on our raffle and tombola. At the Pavilion, Maidenhall Residents’ Association will be busy serving teas and coffees, alongside the CRESS café’s homemade quiche and sandwiches, as well as running stalls and giving children a chance to hook a duck… or a frog! If you are feeling peckish, there will be lots of food to choose from, including authentic Kurdish cuisine, courtesy of the Suffolk Refugee Forum, freshly baked pizza and a hearty barbeque. You can round it all off with delicious Alder Tree ice cream. For more information, or if you would like to hold an activity/ stand at future events, please contact ActivLives on 01473 345350.</p>\\r\\n",

It seems the people of Haverhill people love to have their blood curdled and their bones chilled and the event has got more and more popular over the years. The new system will hopefully mean families can pick the time that suits them best and allow them to see the ghoulish attractions quicker.’ Dressing up is always encouraged but it is important to wear suitable shoes. Children must be accompanied by an adult. There is no parking available at East Town Park and not all the site is accessible to those with pushchairs or in wheelchairs.

The parade will start at the Police Station – led once again by The Suffolk School of Samba who will get the party started with their infectious music and dance – it will make its way up the High Street for the Festival opening at noon. Then onto South Green where people can display their wheeled contraptions. There will be prizes awarded for the best creations. The categories will be - Pram or buggy - Under 8 - 8-12 - 12-16 - 16+ - Business/Group - Best in show The competition will be judged by Ron Fuller, who has been making automata, gifts, clocks and whirligigs for 43 years. Organisers have chosen the wheelie theme so that people can take part at any level, from simply decorating their buggy to making elaborate creations out of wheels. All wheeled items must be pedal powered, nothing motorised please. The inspiration for the parade came from a similar event in Todmorden, Yorkshire – The Fantastical Cycle Parade – which was part of the Tour de France celebrations in 2014. Stay around after the parade for bands, choirs, street entertainers and some surprising contraptions popping up around the High Street. Anyone wanting more information about taking part can do so by e-mailing us at info@southwoldartsfestival.co.uk</div>\\r\\n",
